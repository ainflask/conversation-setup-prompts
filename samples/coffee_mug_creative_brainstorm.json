  "description": "This is a sample brainstorm idea and seeking agentic advices.",
  "scenario": "I have an idea for a new product and need help refining it.",
  "problem": "I want to create a smart coffee mug that keeps drinks at my preferred temperature. My target customers are remote workers aged 25-40 who drink 3+ cups of coffee per day. My budget for manufacturing is $25 per unit, and I want to sell it for under $80.",
  "goal": "Generate exactly 5 key features that would make this product compelling, suggest 3 potential brand names, and identify the top 2 competitors I should research.",
  "constraints": "Focus only on features that are technically feasible with current technology and fit within the $25 manufacturing budget. Do not suggest features that require subscription services or ongoing costs.",
  "chat_hints": "Consider features like: adjustable temperature settings (120-150°F range), battery life (minimum 4 hours), app connectivity for presets, LED temperature indicator, and dishwasher-safe design. For brand names, think about words related to warmth, precision, or daily routines. For competitors, look at Ember Mug and similar products."
